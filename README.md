MÂ² and Modal Analysis of Non--Gaussian Beams
This repository contains the Python source code for the paper titled:
"MÂ² and Modal Analysis of Non-Gaussian Beams: A Noise-Resilient Single-Plane Framework"
by Kenneth A. Menard
The framework presented in the paper provides a versatile and noise-tolerant tool for the complete physical characterization of a wide range of laser beam types, using only single-plane complex field measurements. This code allows for the full reproduction of all simulation results presented in the revised manuscript submitted to the Journal of Optics.
ðŸ”§ Installation
This code requires Python 3. Using a dedicated virtual environment is strongly recommended.
1. Clone the repository
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/kamtalk/M2-of-Non-Gaussian-Beams.git
cd M2-of-Non-Gaussian-Beams
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
code
Bash
# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install required dependencies
code
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
ðŸš€ Usage
The code is organized into modular scripts that can be run independently to reproduce the main results from the paper.
ðŸ“Š Reproducing Table 1
Run the following script to simulate and print all beam characterization data shown in Table 1 to the console:
code
Bash
python generate_table_1.py```

### ðŸ“ˆ Generating the Figures

Run the following scripts to generate the figures from the revised manuscript. The output images will be saved in the project's root directory.

*   **Figure 2:** Analysis of a strongly aberrated beam with a mismatched HG basis.
    ```bash
    python generate_figure_2.py
    ```

*   **Figure 3 (New):** The framework's diagnostic capabilities, comparing a failed perturbation fit with a successful `AddModes` fit.
    ```bash
    python generate_figure_mismatch_diagnostic.py
    ```

*   **Figure 4 (Revised):** The noise robustness plot with statistically significant error bars from a Monte Carlo analysis.
    ```bash
    python Frameworks_noise_robustness.py
    ```

*   **Figure 5 (New):** A visual demonstration of the framework's noise-filtering capabilities.
    ```bash
    python generate_figure_noise_filtering.py
    ```
